## React - Wookie Movies

### Description

This is my solution to a [demo](https://codesubmit.io/library/react) take-home assignment with heavy router usage done over the course of a week in a spare time.

### Tasks

-   Implement your designs usingÂ **React Components** and style them using **CSS3**
-   Connect your application to the **CodeSubmit Movie Database** at https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies
-   For authentication pass the "Authorization: Bearer Wookie2019" header
-   Parse the API response and display the results as outlined in the design. **Group movies by category**.
-   Implement a detail view for the movies in the list
-   Make sure that bookmarking / linking to detail pages works as expected
-   Implement search by connecting to https://wookie.codesubmit.io/movies?q=<search_term>
-   You may use any state management library of your choice as well as common routing libraries

### Evaluation Criteria

-   Design implemented according to attached files using React Components
-   Routing implemented (list, detail) + bookmarking
-   Connect to API - Movies retrieved, JSON parsed, grouped by category
-   Connecting to API Search, search functionality is working
-   Bonus: Use the movies backdrop image creatively
-   Bonus: Use the movies slug for routing
